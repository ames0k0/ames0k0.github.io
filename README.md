# Thoughts for a new app or system
#### When can we just "live", what are you waiting for ?
- Is it all about money ? Your life and what are you doing with it...
- What it looks like ? World without money...
- What do you actually need to live ? Does your body need a money ?
- There is so many problems, but what makes them a problem ?

#### Wait a minute... Do you really wanna "live" ?
- Don't search for a reason if you're not interested in
- You're wake up, now what ?
- How many missions do you have ?
